# Measure of Center

* Mode
    * Bimode: eg: female and male foot size;
    * change the bin size will change the mode
* Mean
    * the mean of the sample can infer the mean of the population
    * outlier is very misleading
    * example of mean bias: [wedding cost](http://www.slate.com/articles/life/weddings/2013/06/average_wedding_cost_published_numbers_on_the_price_of_a_wedding_are_totally.html)
* Median
    * Median is robust

Distribution:

1. left-skewed distribution (mode < median < mean)
2. right-skewed distribution (mean < media < mode)
3. normal distribution
